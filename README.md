QuarkBar is similar to the WordPress implementation of an administration bar. QuarkBar is currently in beta.

Developed by Zachary Schuessler of [http://zaclee.net](http://zaclee.net), found on Twitter via [@zschuessler](https://twitter.com/#!/zschuessler). Made possible with the many hours of
Magento love I enjoy working at [Delta Systems](http://deltasys.com).

Get QuarkBar!
-------------

If you are only looking to download QuarkBar, the .tgz package in the root directory is the extension package. Download and install.

See problems? Have feedback? *Please* create an issue so I can keep track of it.

### Why The Name?

Quark is easily one of the best Star Trek: Deep Space Nine characters of all time. This extension creates an admin 'bar' -- Quark owns a bar! QuarkBar.
